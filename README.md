Easily update modpacks to different Minecraft versions with the Modrinth API (Labrinth).


How to use:
Install the 'mod.py', the 'requirements.txt' file and the config folder.
Use the 'requirements.txt' file by opening the terminal in the directory and typing 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
Alternatively you can install the requirements manually by typing 'pip install requests' and 'pip install pyyaml' in the terminal.
Now the program should be able to run. As a test you can run it with the standard config files. Make sure the folder where your files are stored has the subfolders 'mods' and 'mods2' if you want to do so.
If it doesn't work, make sure you run it in the terminal, to see potential error messages. If it works, you can start configuring your own mods to update. Use the examples in the config folder as guidance. All configuration files need to be stored in said folder and have the ending '.yaml'. If you know what you're doing, you can modify the python file to suit your needs, otherwise I would strongly discourage it, as it may seriously damage files on your computer, still you can always redownload the unmodified file from here if you break the program.
